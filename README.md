# GuessNum_Game

I Built a Simple Game To Show You an example of a Algorithm In Programming.

The Game Is Like This: 
First You Choose a Number In Your Head And Then You Give The Range Of That Number To The Script For Example I Choose 23 In My Head And Then I Give The Script 1-100 Then The Script Asks You Some Question To Guess The Number In Your Head Using a Simple Algorithm.
